Donate:
Team First is a community-supported team with students of different ages. Since we are not a school based team, we don’t get funding or support from the school. We would really appreciate it if you could donate to and/or sponsor our team. We will proudly share information about the sponsors on our website and place their logo on our robot. As a team that has been qualified for FLL in the last few years, we know that the FTC competitions will require dedication and hard work. In order to qualify this year in FTC we need the right materials to perform at our best. We are looking for financial support, and would like to represent our sponsors and our community by delivering the best outcomes.

Where will the funds be used?
The team will spend the funds to purchase FTC Master Kit (Go-Builda), FTC Robot parts, Control and Communications resources such as Electronics, Base Kit, Expansion Hub, and, and Software licenses. We will also be able to utilize these funds towards FTC event registrations such as FTC Program registrations, Qualifying tournaments registrations, and any advancement registrations such as Super qualifiers, and State championships.

Suggested donation? / How much do you need for this season? Budget sheet?
Based on our initial estimates, we will require approximately $6,000 to support the resources listed above. Here is a list of suggested donation options for various levels of corporate sponsorships.
