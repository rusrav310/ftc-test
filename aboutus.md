About us:
We are Team First, an FTC community team based in California. Our team’s philosophy is simple - Team comes first in every decision and effort we make ! We played with lego blocks since we were kindergartners. All of us have participated in the First Lego league for 2-3 years prior to registering for FTC this year. We are committed to work hard and try our best to qualify for FTC. Our team consists of 7 middle school students. We are a group of passionate enthusiasts with diverse strengths ranging from builders, software programmers, to communicators, led by coaches and mentors. Our team consists of varied musicians, and artists. Our team members are learning to play different musical instruments such as Tabla (Indian classical drums), ______, Saxophone, and _______. Yeah - we love homemade (that our Mom’s prepare) snacks and food the best !
