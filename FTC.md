First Tech Challenge (FTC) is a competition, in which each team participating are challenged to design, and program a robot to compete in a challenge given at the start of each season. Along with the robot operation, the team has to be able to raise funds to pay for the costs of the competition, market their teamâ€™s brand, and outreach to the community. This challenge helps students enhance and think like engineers. By participating in FTC children can increase their problem-solving and teamwork skills. FTC builds confidence in children and teaches them many skills that will help throughout their careers.
